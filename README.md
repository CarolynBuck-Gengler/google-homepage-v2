# Recreating Google homepage as part of The Odin Project course, second attempt
I'm working through The Odin Project Web Development 101 course. This project aims to tie together the things I've been learning so far, including and especially working with git and GitHub.
In this second attempt I am going to use git commits step by step as shown in a different tutorial, and also explicitly use grid to try a particular method of sticky footer and try to get it to work.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

The skills I've been working on while doing this project included
* sticky footers
* grid layout (simple, but to get sticky footer to work)
* horizontal navigation bars where some items are on the left and others on the right
* placement of items on the page and subtle adjustments to margin and padding
* styling of elements when hovered
* more advanced use of the Chrome DevTools
